  GTTS (Google Text to Speech)




                                        
google search through our voice in the Python Programming Language.
Later, going to use GTTS (Google text to Speech) for converting the text into speech again.
we can instantly get the speech output from text and can make our own Python Assistant, by using the PYGLET framework for playing the responses instantly within the program!

pyglet framework - gtts convert text to speech and save the audio and pyglet will play that speech.

objective -
build a system that automatically search on a google through our voice in the Python Programming Language using google speech recognition API and show the result of the google search first link by the use of beautifulsoup.and use GTTS (Google text to Speech) for converting the text into speech again.so that we can instantly get the speech output from text and can make our own Python Assistant, by using the PYGLET framework for playing the responses instantly within the program.
